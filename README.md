# Slack Events Relay

While working on [`launch-vehicle-fbm`](https://github.com/CondeNast/launch-vehicle-fbm), my team started writing a  client to dump chat interactions to a private Slack channel for debugging purposes. This evolved into [`messenger-slack-ghost`](https://github.com/crccheck/messenger-slack-ghost). What I am looking to do here is evolve this concept into something I can use to debug events on websites I manage by providing some details to a Slack channel.

## Prerequisites

Access to a Slack team with the permissions to create an application and bot user are required. Slack will provide a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and this token needs to be available in the runtime environment.

Use [`example.env`](./example.env) as a guide.

My workflow is to copy this file to `.env` and use `export $(cat .env | xargs)` to prepare the environment.

## Usage

* `npm i` to install dependencies
* `npm run dev` to start a local instance of the
application with a file watcher

With the _dev_ target running, _http://localhost:8080_ will provide an HTTP `200` response with a ðŸ¤– in the body.

The _dev_ target assumes [_nodemon_] is installed and available globally; it is not included in the project dependencies.

[_nodemon_]: http://nodemon.io/

## Logging and metrics

**TODO**: The [debug] package is for a firehose of data sent to stdout/stderr
